# Portfolio Project

This is a personal portfolio project developed using ReactJS. The project showcases various aspects of my skills, experience, and projects I have worked on. It is designed to highlight my abilities as a developer and provide potential clients or employers with insights into my work.

## Features

- **Interactive SVG Animations:** Includes SVG icons that swap and animate seamlessly to add a touch of personality.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Multi-language Support:** Integrated with `react-i18next` for easy language switching and localization.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** Core library for building the user interface.
- **CSS:** Custom styling for animations and layout.
